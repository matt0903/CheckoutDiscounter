#About
This gem was built with the following in mind:

Our marketing team want to offer promotions as an incentive for
our customers to purchase these items.

If you spend over £60, then you get 10% off your purchase
If you buy 2 or more travel card holders then the price drops to
£8.50.

Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because our
promotions will change, it needs to be flexible regarding our
promotional rules.

The checkout test can be run by running:

`rspec spec/checkout_spec.rb`
